Classwork for COMP2406 web applications
I think this is all the necessary files, I was having some difficulty uploading this many files.
This is mainly for future reference and backup.

Assignment 1 was basic javascript, using it to solve simple problems

Assignment 3 was a basic class management system that allowed professors to issue projects, TAs to grade them, and students to turn them in.
Logins can be created by the admin.

Assignment 4 was a file parsing program that would read a text file and attempt to display the file if it was a song with its chords.
The program doesn't correctly display the chords at this time.

Files outside of the assignment files are tutorials.
